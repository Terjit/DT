					Building a compliation of GUI tools useful in drilling engineering with python. 
					Tools include
						Directional survey calculation based on MD, INC, AZI to produce plan and section views of wells and 3D plots of well and pads.
						Well builder that allows for the generation of a well schematic based on casing and tubing sizes enterd by user.
						Cementing tools allowing for the calculation of cement volumes for desired cement placement.
						Hydraulic calculations to determind pressure losses during drilling and allow for proper backpressure required for desired ECD.
						Torque and drag calculatiosn based on BHA, well trejectory, and fluid properties entered by user.
